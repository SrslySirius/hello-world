# hello-world

I'm Thomas Keeling. My profession is in video and online content production, but I have been learning Python as a hobby for the last couple years. I have built a few applications for fun and to simplify my work. I also have dabbled in HTML and CSS for many years.

I am now editing this file on my desktop.
